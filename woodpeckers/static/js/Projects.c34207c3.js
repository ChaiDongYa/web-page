It has a total area of 1455 square kilometers, 210,000 mu of commonly used arable land, 11 towns, 113 administrative villages, and 4 communities, with a total population of 210,000, including 187,000 agricultural population, 13,400 poor households, and 35,100 poor population. Baihe is not only a key county for poverty alleviation and development in China, but also a contiguous area for poverty alleviation in the Qinba area of Zhongjia. Among the poverty-stricken counties in China, Baihe County is a typical underdeveloped agricultural county. The overall level of economic and social development in the county is not high, the income of the poor is difficult to increase, and the quality of infrastructure such as rural roads, water, electricity, health, medical care, and communications is poor. Low, the deep-seated contradictions restricting economic development still exist, and the task of poverty alleviation and development is still very arduous. There are 78 impoverished villages in the county. The impoverished population accounts for 18.8% of the rural population, which is 3.8 times the basic level of China and 1.5 times the basic level of the whole province. The extent of poverty has not yet been fundamentally changed. After years of poverty alleviation, although most of the poor have been lifted out of poverty, what is left is some difficult "hard bones". In addition, the natural conditions are poor, the foundation is relatively weak, the cost of poverty alleviation and development is high, and it is still very difficult for the masses to get out of poverty. The new task of poverty alleviation remains arduous.

It is a typical case of promoting the practice of targeted poverty alleviation."},{con:"Danfeng County is located at the south foot of the east section of Qinling Mountains. It is a small county and a key county for poverty alleviation and development in mountainous areas of the country. At present, the total population of the county is 304000 and the agricultural population is 258000, but the cultivated land area is only 230000 mu, and the per capita cultivated land of farmers is less than one mu. When encountering disasters such as drought, flood and hail, rural residents even face the difficulty of not having enough to eat, resulting in prominent poverty. Data show that there are more than 20000 poor households and more than 80000 people in Danfeng County. Last year, the total financial revenue of Danfeng County was 300 million yuan, and the per capita net income of farmers was 5536 yuan. An important feature of poverty in Danfeng County is the large number of rural surplus labor force. According to the data provided by Danfeng County, there are more than 110000 rural labor forces in Danfeng County, and more than 80000 rural surplus labor forces.\nThe existence of a large number of rural surplus labor force not only causes heavy pressure on resources and environment, but also affects the realization of the government's development goals and the improvement of population quality. In the practice of poverty alleviation, the county takes the transfer of rural surplus labor force as an important channel to get rid of poverty and become rich. According to the current situation of Danfeng County and absorbing local experience and practices, Danfeng County puts forward a series of strategic ideas to promote the transfer of rural surplus labor force, so as to improve people's employment rate and income generation.\n"}],button:"learn more"},{img:o("d7a8"),title:"PROJECT 4",content:[{con:"his picture shows the learning situation of students in poverty-stricken areas of China.

My sister was proud of her father Xu Qinshan for her excellent grades since childhood. She was admitted to Shandong Institute of management four years ago. In school, the person my sister cares about most is Haohao except grandma in the nursing home. Because during holidays and weekends, Haohao is always alone at home.
